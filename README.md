## Try it

You can find a demo [here](https://jargon-reloaded.firebaseapp.com/).

## Modify it

Running `npm run fetch` launches the scrapping on http://catb.org/jargon and updates the `src/entries.json`, which is necessary for the frontend to display anything.
Then, running `npm run start` launches the live-reloading server.

## Build it

Just run `npm build` and the dist folder will contain the built files.
