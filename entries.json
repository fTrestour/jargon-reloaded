    "description": " Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter ‘O’ (the 15th letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they look a lot alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have compounded the confusion.  If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O is not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero looks more like an American football stood on end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at a modern character display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII graphic set descended from the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom � is a letter, curse this arrangement). (Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates computers; Florian Cajori's monumental A History of Mathematical Notations notes that it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has a slash across it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very old convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse this arrangement even more, because it means two of their letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero with a reversed slash. Old CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken at upper right and lower left.  And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII characters, but the final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left corner).  Are we sufficiently confused yet?",

    "description": " A declaration of victory or superiority. The phrase stems from a 1991 adaptation of Toaplan's “Zero Wing” shoot-'em-up arcade game for the Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added to the opening screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst Japanese-to-English translation in video game history. The introduction shows the bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS materializes and says, “How are you gentlemen!!  All your base are belong to us.” [sic] In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread virally through the Internet, bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie of hacked photographs, each showing a street sign, store front, package label, etc. hacked to read “All your base are belong to us” or one of the other many supremely dopey lines from the game (such as “Somebody set up usthe bomb!!!” or “What happen?”). When these phrases are used properly, the overall effect is both screamingly funny and somewhat chilling, reminiscent of the B movie “They Live”.",

This leads many hackers and would-be hackers into fooling with these instead of doing productive work. There are many Angband variants, of which the most notorious is probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In this game, when a key that does not correspond to a command is pressed, the game will display “Type ? for help” 50% of the time.  The other 50% of the time, random error messages including “An error has occurred because an error of type 42 has occurred” and “Windows 95 uninstalled successfully” will be displayed.  Zangband also allows the player to kill Santa Claus (who has some really good stuff, but also has a lot of friends), “Bull Gates”, and Barney the Dinosaur (but be watchful; Barney has a nasty case of halitosis). There is an official angband home page at http://thangorodrim.angband.org/ and a zangband one at http://www.zangband.org/.  See also Random Number God.",

The affected user will come back to find a post from them on internal newsgroups discussing exactly how baggy their pants are, an accepted stand-in for “unattentive user who left their work unprotected in the clusters”. A properly-done baggy pantsing is highly mocking and humorous.  It is considered bad form to post a baggy pantsing to off-campus newsgroups or the more technical, serious groups.  A particularly nice baggy pantsing may be “claimed” by immediately quoting the message in full, followed by your sig block; this has the added benefit of keeping the embarassed victim from being able to delete the post.  Interesting baggy-pantsings have been done involving adding commands to login scripts to repost the message every time the unlucky user logs in; Unix boxes on the residential network, when cracked, oftentimes have their homepages replaced (after being politely backed-up to another file) with a baggy-pants message; .plan files are also occasionally targeted. Usage: “Prof. Greenlee fell asleep in the Solaris cluster again; we baggy-pantsed him to git.cc.class.2430.flame.” Compare derf.",

A novice can write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well.  This wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros in the 1980s.  As it is, it probably ruined tens of thousands of potential wizards.",

    "description": " In 1997, after meditating on the success of Linux for three years, the Jargon File's own editor ESR wrote an analytical paper on hacker culture and development models titled  The Cathedral and the Bazaar.  The main argument of the paper was that Brooks's Law is not the whole story; given the right social machinery, debugging can be efficiently parallelized across large numbers of programmers.  The title metaphor caught on (see also cathedral), and the style of development typical in the Linux community is now often referred to as the bazaar mode.  Its characteristics include releasing code early and often, and actively seeking the largest possible pool of peer reviewers. After 1998, the evident success of this way of doing things became one of the strongest arguments for open source.",

The term was especially applied to the thousands of local BBS systems that operated during the pre-Internet microcomputer era of roughly 1980 to 1995, typically run by amateurs for fun out of their homes on MS-DOS boxes with a single modem line each.  Fans of Usenet and Internet or the big commercial timesharing bboards such as CompuServe and GEnie tended to consider local BBSes the low-rent district of the hacker culture, but they served a valuable function by knitting together lots of hackers and users in the personal-micro world who would otherwise have been unable to exchange code at all.  Post-Internet, BBSs are likely to be local newsgroups on an ISP; efficiency has increased but a certain flavor has been lost.  See also bboard.",

It is remarkable for its rich syntax, small size of compiler (it can be run in 16k) and extreme portability. It reached break-even point at a very early stage, and was the language in which the original hello world program was written. It has been ported to so many different systems that its creator confesses to having lost count. It has only one data type (a machine word) which can be used as an integer, a character, a floating point number, a pointer, or almost anything else, depending on context.

The ASR-33 was a mechanical device (see EOU), so the only way to generate the character codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of the ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed.  In order to avoid making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design had to group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one key.",

Bogosity is measured with a bogometer; in a seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say “My bogometer just triggered”.

It has been received wisdom in most programming cultures that it is best to design from higher levels of abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences of action in increasing detail until you get to actual code.  Hackers often find (especially in exploratory designs that cannot be closely specified in advance) that it works best to build things in the opposite order, by writing and testing a clean set of primitive operations and then knitting them together.  Naively applied, this leads to hacked-together bottom-up implementations; a more sophisticated response is middle-out implementation, in which scratch code within primitives at the mid-level of the system is gradually replaced with a more polished version of the lowest level at the same time the structure above the midlevel is being built.

    "description": " What happens when you try to stuff more data into a buffer (holding area) than it can handle.  This problem is commonly exploited by crackers to get arbitrary commands executed by a program running with root permissions.  This may be due to a mismatch in the processing rates of the producing and consuming processes (see overrun and  firehose syndrome), or because the buffer is simply too small to hold all the data that must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed. For example, in a text-processing tool that crunches a line at a time, a short line buffer can result in lossage as input from a long line overflows the buffer and trashes data beyond it.  Good defensive programming would check for overflow on each character and stop accepting data when the buffer is full up.  The term is used of and by humans in a metaphorical sense. “What time did I agree to meet you?  My buffer must have overflowed.” Or “If I answer that phone my buffer is going to overflow.” See also spam,  overrun screw.",

This practice contrasts with the C tradition of either running syllables together or marking syllable breaks with underscores; thus, where a C programmer would write thisverylongname or this_very_long_name, the camelCased version would be thisVeryLongName. This practice is common in certain language communities (formerly Pascal; today Java and Visual Basic) and tends to be associated with object-oriented programming.",

Often, such a condition being true indicates data corruption or a faulty algorithm; it is almost always handled by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or crashing, since there is little else that can be done. Some case variant of “can't happen” is also often the text emitted if the ‘impossible’ error actually happens!  Although “can't happen” events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers wise enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how frequently they are triggered during development and how many headaches checking for them turns out to head off.

This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs.

Public projects often have a chainik mailing list to keep the chainiks off the developers' and experienced users' discussions.

    "description": " [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a machine word). This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late 1970s/early 1980s; it is said to have been archaic then, and may now be obsolete.  It was coined in revolt against the promiscuous use of ‘word’ for anything between 16 and 32 bits; ‘word’ has an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that made the overloading intolerable.  For similar reasons, /gaw�bl/ (spelled ‘gawble’ or possibly ‘gawbul’) was in use as a term for 32 or 48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are unclear on this).  These terms are more easily understood if one thinks of them as faithful phonetic spellings of ‘chomp’ and ‘gobble’ pronounced in a Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect.  For general discussion of similar terms, see nybble.",

    "description": " Hackish speech makes heavy use of pseudo-mathematical metaphors. Four particularly important ones involve the terms coefficient, factor, index of X, and quotient.  They are often loosely applied to things you cannot really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions among them that convey information about the way the speaker mentally models whatever he or she is describing. Foo factor and foo quotient tend to describe something for which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical example is fudge factor.  It's not important how much you're fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.  You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.  Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two opposing factors: “I would have won except for my luck quotient.” This could also be “I would have won except for the luck factor”, but using quotient emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering your own).  Foo index and coefficient of foo both tend to imply that foo is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that can be larger or smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or person as having a high bogosity index, whereas you would be less likely to speak of a high bogosity factor.  Foo index suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane cost-of-living index; coefficient of foo suggests that foo is a fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction.  The choice between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus say coefficient of bogosity, whereas others might feel it is a combination of factors and thus say bogosity index.",

After the demise of the space-cadet keyboard, cokebottle faded away as serious usage, but was often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird or non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due for a second inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager, mwm(1), has a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of keybindings and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not) ‘control-meta-bang’ (see bang).

Lawrence Clark's A Linguistic Contribution to GOTO-less programming, which appeared in a 1973 Datamation issue (and was reprinted in the April 1984 issue of Communications of the ACM).  This parodied the then-raging ‘structured programming’ holy wars (see considered harmful).  Mythically, some variants are the assigned COME FROM and the computed COME FROM (parodying some nasty control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course, multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more than one COME FROM statement coming from the same label.",

As it  turns out, the title under which the letter appeared was actually supplied by CACM's editor, Niklaus Wirth.  Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer print an article taking so assertive a position against a coding practice. (Years afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter called, inevitably, ‘Goto considered harmful’ considered harmful''.  In the ensuing decades, a large number of both serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the form X considered Y.  The structured-programming wars eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were wrong, but use of such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the ‘considered silly’ found at various places in this lexicon is related).",

The game was actually devised and played by Victor Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Doug McIlroy in the early 1960s (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved).  Their original game was called ‘Darwin’ and ran on a IBM 7090 at Bell Labs.  See core.

One can describe an instruction as taking so many clock cycles.  Often the computer can access its memory once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of memory cycles.  These are technical meanings of cycle.  The jargon meaning comes from the observation that there are only so many cycles per second, and when you are sharing a computer the cycles get divided up among the users.  The more cycles the computer spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the faster your program will run.  That's why every hacker wants more cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to respond. ",

For example, under ITS, writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.  The advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT. They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them.

The Unix dd(1) was designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD ‘Dataset Definition’ specification for I/O devices); though the command filled a need, the interface design was clearly a prank.  The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly obsolete even there, as dd(1) has been deprecated for a long time (though it has no exact replacement).

Before the killer micro revolution of the late 1980s, hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's pioneering timesharing machines.  The first of the group of cultures described by this lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see TMRC). Subsequently, the PDP-6, PDP-10, PDP-20, PDP-11 and VAX were all foci of large and important hackerdoms, and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine population.  DEC was the technological leader of the minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after silicon got cheap.  Nevertheless, the microprocessor design tradition owes a major debt to the PDP-11 instruction set, and every one of the major general-purpose microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC hardware, or both. Accordingly, DEC was for many years still regarded with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too young to have grown up on DEC machines.",

Demoscene folklore recounts that when old-time warez d00dz cracked some piece of software they often added an advertisement in the beginning, usually containing colorful display hacks with greetings to other cracking groups.  The demoscene was born among people who decided building these display hacks is more interesting than hacking — or anyway safer.  Around 1990 there began to be very serious police pressure on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into bedrooms to confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or for esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the culture such a hack is called a demo).  As more of these demogroups emerged, they started to have compos at copying parties (see copyparty), which later evolved to standalone events (see demoparty).  The demoscene has retained some traits from the warez d00dz, including their style of handles and group names and some of their jargon.",

Adams, who spent nine years in cube 4S700R at Pacific Bell (not DEC as often reported), often remarks that he has never been able to come up with a fictional management blunder that his correspondents didn't quickly either report to have actually happened or top with a similar but even more bizarre incident.

In the mainframe industry's glory days of the 1960s, it was ‘IBM and the Seven Dwarfs’: Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac. RCA and GE sold out early, and it was ‘IBM and the Bunch’ (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while. Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form Unisys (in 1984 — this was when the phrase dinosaurs mating was coined); and in 1991 AT&T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years later). Control Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe business.  In similar wave of dinosaur-matings as the PC business began to consolidate after 1995, Digital Equipment was bought by Compaq which was bought by Hewlett-Packard.  More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem inevitable.",

For example, when a religious missionary posts a simplistic appeal to alt.atheism, he can expect to be dogpiled. It has been suggested that this derives from U.S. football slang for a tackle involving three or more people; among hackers, it seems at least as likely to derive from an ‘autobiographical’ Bugs Bunny cartoon in which a gang of attacking canines actually yells “Dogpile on the rabbit!”.",

[now obs.] A security or copy protection device for proprietary software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port of the computer while the program is run.  Programs that use a dongle query the port at startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus, users can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for each dongle.  The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with a software product called PaperClip.  The idea was clever, but it was initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way. By 1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor for magic codes (and combinations of status lines) with minimal if any interference with devices further down the line — this innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces of software.  These devices have become rare as the industry has moved away from copy-protection schemes in general.  ",

    "description": " [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a programmable text editor with an entire LISP system inside it.  It was originally written by Richard Stallman in TECO under ITS at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554 described it as “an advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time display editor”.  It has since been reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions exist that run under most major operating systems.  Perhaps the most widely used version, also written by Stallman and now called “GNU EMACS” or GNUMACS, runs principally under Unix.  (Its close relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.)  It includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail or news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their tube time inside it.  Other variants include GOSMACS, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS.  (Though we use the original all-caps spelling here, it is nowadays very commonly ‘Emacs’.)  Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor does not (yet) include.  Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too heavyweight and baroque for their taste, and expand the name as ‘Escape Meta Alt Control Shift’ to spoof its heavy reliance on keystrokes decorated with bucky bits.  Other spoof expansions include ‘Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping’ (from when that was a lot of core), ‘Eventually malloc()s All Computer Storage’, and ‘EMACS Makes A Computer Slow’ (see recursive acronym).  See also vi.",

System time is measured in seconds or ticks past the epoch.  Weird problems may ensue when the clock wraps around (see wrap around), which is not necessarily a rare event; on systems counting 10 ticks per second, a signed 32-bit count of ticks is good only for 6.8 years.  The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is good only until January 18, 2038, assuming at least some software continues to consider it signed and that word lengths don't increase by then.  See also  wall time.  Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, has an epoch problem every 49.7 days — but this is seldom noticed as Windows is almost incapable of staying up continuously for that long.",

Your typical electric utility draws its line current out of the big generators with a pair of coil taps located near the top of the dynamo. When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off line to clean them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the bottom of the coil.  Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get not ordinary or ‘thin’ electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator. These flow down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a sharp corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck. This is what causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.

From the following problem: “If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, how many posts do you need?” (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.)  For example, suppose you have a long list or array of items, and want to process items m through n; how many items are there?  The obvious answer is n - m, but that is off by one; the right answer is n - m + 1.  A program that used the ‘obvious’ formula would have a fencepost error in it.  See also zeroth and  off-by-one error, and note that not all off-by-one errors are fencepost errors.  The game of Musical Chairs involves a catastrophic off-by-one error where N people try to sit in N - 1 chairs, but it's not a fencepost error.  Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row.  ",

    "description": " [very common] Another widely used  metasyntactic variable; see foo for etymology. Probably originally propagated through DECsystem manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and early 1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972.  Hackers do not generally use this to mean FUBAR in either the slang or jargon sense.  See also Fred Foobar.  In RFC1639, “FOOBAR” was made an abbreviation for “FTP Operation Over Big Address Records”, but this was an obvious backronym. It has been plausibly suggested that “foobar” spread among early computer engineers partly because of FUBAR and partly because “foo bar” parses in electronics techspeak as an inverted foo signal; if a digital signal is active low (so a negative or zero-voltage condition represents a \"1\") then a horizontal bar is commonly placed over the signal label.",

Forking is considered a  Bad Thing — not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction.  There is serious social pressure against forking.  As a result, major forks (such as the Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the fissionings of the 386BSD group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.

A fudge factor, on the other hand, can often be tweaked in more than one direction.  A good example is the fuzz typically allowed in floating-point calculations: two numbers being compared for equality must be allowed to differ by a small amount; if that amount is too small, a computation may never terminate, while if it is too large, results will be needlessly inaccurate.

    "description": " The use of large numbers of loosely coupled programmers in an attempt to wedge a great many features into a product in a short time. Though there have been memorable gang bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler port mentioned in Steven Levy's Hackers), and large numbers of loosely-coupled programmers operating in bazaar mode can do very useful work when they're not on a deadline, most are perpetrated by large companies trying to meet unrealistic deadlines; the inevitable result is enormous buggy masses of code entirely lacking in orthogonality.  When market-driven managers make a list of all the features the competition has and assign one programmer to implement each, the probability of maintaining a coherent (or even functional) design goes to epsilon.  See also firefighting,  Mongolian Hordes technique, Conway's Law.",

    "description": " A quick-and-dirty clone of System/360 DOS that emerged from GE around 1970; originally called GECOS (the General Electric Comprehensive Operating System).  Later kluged to support primitive timesharing and transaction processing.  After the buyout of GE's computer division by Honeywell, the name was changed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).  Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it as ‘God's Chosen Operating System’, allegedly in reaction to the GCOS crowd's uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their product.  All this might be of zero interest, except for two facts: (1) The GCOS people won the political war, and this led in the orphaning and eventual death of Honeywell Multics, and (2) GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on Unix.  Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and various other services; the field added to /etc/passwd to carry GCOS ID information was called the GECOS field and survives today as the pw_gecos member used for the user's full name and other human-ID information.  GCOS later played a major role in keeping Honeywell a dismal also-ran in the mainframe market, and was itself mostly ditched for Unix in the late 1980s when Honeywell began to retire its aging big iron designs.",

    "description": " The side-effect that destroyed touch-screens as a mainstream input technology despite a promising start in the early 1980s.  It seems the designers of all those spiffy touch-menu systems failed to notice that humans aren't designed to hold their arms in front of their faces making small motions.  After more than a very few selections, the arm begins to feel sore, cramped, and oversized — the operator looks like a gorilla while using the touch screen and feels like one afterwards.  This is now considered a classic cautionary tale to human-factors designers; “Remember the gorilla arm!” is shorthand for “How is this going to fly in real use?”.",

H-infix marking of ‘Ghod’ and other words spread into the 1960s counterculture via underground comix, and into early hackerdom either from the counterculture or from SF fandom (the three overlapped heavily at the time).  More recently, the h infix has become an expected feature of benchmark names (Dhrystone, Rhealstone, etc.); this is probably patterning on the original Whetstone (the name of a laboratory) but influenced by the fannish/counterculture h infix.",

Syllables and whole words in a sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters the names of which are phonetically similar or equivalent, while multiple letters are usually dropped.  Hence, ‘for’ becomes ‘4’; ‘two’, ‘too’, and ‘to’ become ‘2’; ‘ck’ becomes ‘k’.  “Before I see you tomorrow” becomes “b4 i c u 2moro”.  First appeared in London about 1986, and was probably caused by the slowness of available talker systems, which operated on archaic machines with outdated operating systems and no standard methods of communication.",

For example, a simple program that prints numbers might always print them in base 10, but a more flexible version would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the variable to 5 would make the program print numbers in base 5.  The variable is a simple hook.  An even more flexible program might examine the variable and treat a value of 16 or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number.  This is a hairy but powerful hook; one can then write a routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters, and plug it into the program through the hook.  Often the difference between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has useful hooks in judiciously chosen places.  Both may do the original job about equally well, but the one with the hooks is much more flexible for future expansion of capabilities (EMACS, for example, is all hooks).  The term user exit is synonymous but much more formal and less hackish.",

Such spikes are called hot spots and are good candidates for heavy optimization or hand-hacking.

The shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see  high moby).  There is an ITS home page.",

The  posting was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were moskvax and kgbvax. This was probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them), because the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so totally absurd at the time.",

Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it, and hackers at various places contributed heavily to the mathematical analysis of this game (most notably Bill Gosper at MIT, who even implemented life in TECO!). When a hacker mentions ‘life’, he is much more likely to mean this game than the magazine, the breakfast cereal, or the human state of existence.

The bug was triggered by having the text of the article start with a space or tab. This bug was quickly personified as a mythical creature called the line eater, and postings often included a dummy line of line eater food.  Ironically, line eater ‘food’ not beginning with a space or tab wasn't actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but if there was a space or tab before it, then the line eater would eat the food and the beginning of the text it was supposed to be protecting.  The practice of sacrificing to the line eater continued for some time after the bug had been nailed to the wall, and is still humorously referred to.  The bug itself was still occasionally reported to be lurking in some mail-to-netnews gateways as late as 1991. ",

Under ITS, when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer; it might print “14 users”, for example. Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print “14 losers” instead.  There ensued a great controversy, as some of the users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their faces every time they used the computer.  For a while several hackers struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it would say “users” or “losers”.  Finally, someone tried the compromise “lusers”, and it stuck.  Later one of the ITS machines supported luser as a request-for-help command.  ITS died the death in mid-1990, except as a museum piece; the usage lives on, however, and the term luser is often seen in program comments and on Usenet.  Compare mundane, muggle, newbie, chainik.",

    "description": " Term originally referring to the cabinet containing the central processor unit or ‘main frame’ of a room-filling Stone Age batch machine.  After the emergence of smaller minicomputer designs in the early 1970s, the traditional big iron machines were described as ‘mainframe computers’ and eventually just as mainframes.  The term carries the connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive use, though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of machines built by IBM, Unisys, and the other great dinosaurs surviving from computing's Stone Age.",

With the advent of virtual memory, it is unfortunately easier to be sloppy about wasting a bit of memory (although when you run out of memory on a VM machine, it means you've got a real leak!).

For example, in some versions of the EMACS text editor, the ‘transpose characters’ command exchanges the character under the cursor with the one before it on the screen, except when the cursor is at the end of a line, in which case the two characters before the cursor are exchanged.  While this behavior is perhaps surprising, and certainly inconsistent, it has been found through extensive experimentation to be what most users want.  This feature is a miswart.",

The original Moore's Law, first uttered in 1965 by semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four years later), spoke of the number of components on the lowest-cost silicon integrated circuits — but Moore's own formulation varied somewhat over the years, and reconstructing the meaning of the terminology he used in the original turns out to be fraught with difficulties.

Microsoft licensed QDOS in order to have something to demo for IBM on time, and the rest is history.  Numerous features, including vaguely Unix-like but rather broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection, and pipelines, were hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as a result, there are two or more incompatible versions of many system calls, and MS-DOS programmers can never agree on basic things like what character to use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive.  The resulting appalling mess is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history.  Often known simply as DOS, which annoys people familiar with other similarly abbreviated operating systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when it was attached to IBM's first disk operating system for the 360).  The name further annoys those who know what the term  operating system does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more properly a set of relatively simple interrupt services.  Some people like to pronounce DOS like “dose”, as in “I don't work on dose, man!”, or to compare it to a dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide circulation among hackers exhorts: “MS-DOS: Just say No!”).

Assuming that you have no wife or you have never beaten your wife, the answer “yes” is wrong because it implies that you used to beat your wife and then stopped, but “no” is worse because it suggests that you have one and are still beating her.  According to various Discordians and Douglas Hofstadter the correct answer is usually “mu”, a Japanese word alleged to mean “Your question cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions”.  Hackers tend to be sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and many have adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm.  The word ‘mu’ is actually from Chinese, meaning ‘nothing’; it is used in mainstream Japanese in that sense. In Chinese it can also mean “have not” (as in “I have not done it”), or “lack of”, which may or may not be a definite, complete 'nothing').  Native speakers of Japanese do not recognize the Discordian question-denying use, which almost certainly derives from overgeneralization of the answer in the following well-known Rinzai Zen koan:",

The initial value of T is treated as a parameter, which, when well-chosen, can produce amazing effects.  Some of these, later (re)discovered on the LISP machine, have been christened munching triangles (try AND for XOR and toggling points instead of plotting them), munching w's, and munching mazes.  More generally, suppose a graphics program produces an impressive and ever-changing display of some basic form, foo, on a display terminal, and does it using a relatively simple program; then the program (or the resulting display) is likely to be referred to as munching foos.  [This is a good example of the use of the word foo as a metasyntactic variable.]",

Folk music is very big in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of elaborate instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called ‘progressive’ and isn't recorded much any more.  The hacker's musical range tends to be wide; many can listen with equal appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti.

More importantly, neats tend to believe that logic is king, while scruffies favor looser, more ad-hoc methods driven by empirical knowledge.  To a neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident, and not productive of insights about how intelligence actually works; to a scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant to the hard-to-capture ‘common sense’ of living intelligences.",

In any nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to a higher spl level).  Then another machine tries to reach either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is now trying both to access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one, so it is even harder to reach.  This situation snowballs very quickly, and soon the entire network of machines is frozen — worst of all, the user can't even abort the file access that started the problem!  Many of NFS's problems are excused by partisans as being an inevitable result of its statelessness, which is held to be a great feature (critics, of course, call it a great misfeature).  (ITS partisans are apt to cite this as proof of Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working NFS-like shared file system with none of these problems in the early 1970s.)  See also broadcast storm.",

A one-banana problem is simple; hence, “It's only a one-banana job at the most; what's taking them so long?” At IBM, folklore divides the world into one-, two-, and three-banana problems.  Other cultures have different hierarchies and may divide them more finely; at ICL, for example, five grapes (a bunch) equals a banana.  Their upper limit for the in-house sysapes is said to be two bananas and three grapes (another source claims it's three bananas and one grape, but observes “However, this is subject to local variations, cosmic rays and ISO”).

This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also bondage-and-discipline language).  The hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of K&R fame) entitled Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language, which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies.  It was eventually published in Comparing and Assessing Programming Languages, edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984).  Part of his discussion is worth repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after many years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages.  (The entire essay is available at http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html.) At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:",

It looms large in hacker folklore because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU. Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed.  The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines (descendants of the PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX product lines were competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable VAX.  The machine was finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a viable new model.  (Some attempts by other companies to market clones came to nothing; see Foonly and Mars.)  This event spelled the doom of ITS and the technical cultures that had spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth on a PDP-10.

PostScript gets its leverage by using a full programming language, rather than a series of low-level escape sequences, to describe an image to be printed on a laser printer or other output device (in this it parallels EMACS, which exploited a similar insight about editing tasks).  It is also noteworthy for implementing on-the fly rasterization, from Bezier curve descriptions, of high-quality fonts at low (e.g.  300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task). Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time, and the combination of technical merits and widespread availability has made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.",

    "description": " [from TV programming] Normal high-usage hours on a system or network.  Back in the days of big timesharing machines ‘prime time’ was when lots of people were competing for limited cycles, usually the day shift.  Avoidance of prime time was traditionally given as a major reason for night mode hacking.  The term fell into disuse during the early PC era, but has been revived to refer to times of day or evening at which the Internet tends to be heavily loaded, making Web access slow.  The hackish tendency to late-night hacking runs has changed not a bit.",

This very common term is likely a holdover from the days when printing terminals were the norm, perpetuated by programming language constructs like C's printf(3). See senses 1 and 2 of tty.",

The term rav is short for ‘ravioli’, and among hackers always means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind. Both consist of a filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind includes no cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling (good ones include Chinese chives), and is cooked differently, either by steaming or frying.  A rav or dumpling can be cooked any way, but a potsticker is always the pan-fried kind (so called because it sticks to the frying pot and has to be scraped off).  “Let's get hot-and-sour soup and three orders of ravs.” See also oriental food.",

    "description": " [indirectly, from the book Real Men Don't Eat Quiche] A particular sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience.  The archetypal Real Programmer likes to program on the bare metal and is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps. Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been tuned into a state of tenseness just short of rupture.  Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation: “If it was hard to write”, says the Real Programmer, “it should be hard to understand.” Real Programmers can make machines do things that were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really happy unless doing so.  A Real Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls.  Real Programmers live on junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the crap out of other programmers — because someday, somebody else might have to try to understand their code in order to change it.  Their successors generally consider it a Good Thing that there aren't many Real Programmers around any more.  For a famous (and somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, see The Story of Mel' in Appendix A.  The term itself was popularized by a letter to the editor in the July 1983 Datamation titled Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal by Ed Post, still circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line form.",

This “strategy” never works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles like the RTM worm of 1988 (see  Great Worm), but once the brief moments of panic created by such events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn over and go back to sleep.  After all, actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources needed to implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list — and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers might begin to expect it and imagine that their warranties of merchantability gave them some sort of right to a system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and then where would we be?",

One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking any sense of netiquette, made a general nuisance of themselves. This coincided with people starting college, getting their first internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what was acceptable.  These relatively small drafts of newbies could be assimilated within a few months.  But in September 1993, AOL users became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers' capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the period before, this triggered an inexorable decline in the quality of discussions on newsgroups.  Syn. eternal September. See also AOL!.",

This legend began with a fraternity prank in 1958 during which the body length of Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was actually used to measure out that distance. It is commemorated by smoot marks that MIT students repaint every few years; the tradition even survived the demolition and rebuilding of the bridge in the late 1980s.  The Boston police have been known to use smoot markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge.  Apparently Smoot's experience as a unit of measurement led to a life-long career; he eventually became Chairman of the Board of the American National Standards Institute, and later President of the International Organization for Standardization.",

One speaks of the next project to be attacked as having risen to the top of the stack. “I'm afraid I've got real work to do, so this'll have to be pushed way down on my stack.” “I haven't done it yet because every time I pop my stack something new gets pushed.” If you are interrupted several times in the middle of a conversation, “My stack overflowed” means “I forget what we were talking about.” The implication is that more items were pushed onto the stack than could be remembered, so the least recent items were lost.  The usual physical example of a stack is to be found in a cafeteria: a pile of plates or trays sitting on a spring in a well, so that when you put one on the top they all sink down, and when you take one off the top the rest spring up a bit.

Though Sun drifted away from its techie origins after 1990 and has since made some strategic moves that disappointed and annoyed many hackers (especially by maintaining proprietary control of Java and rejecting Linux), it's still considered within the family in much the same way DEC was in the 1970s and early 1980s.",

This range is astonishing; it is matched in very few other areas of human endeavor.)  The term superprogrammer is more commonly used within such places as IBM than in the hacker community.  It tends to stress naive measures of productivity and to underweight creativity, ingenuity, and getting the job done — and to sidestep the question of whether the 3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work than three lines that do the Right Thing.

The early hacker culture of the 1960s and 1970s grew up around the first generation of relatively cheap timesharing computers, notably the DEC 10, 11, and VAX lines.  But these were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit less powerful than today's personal computers, they had to be shared by dozens or even hundreds of people each.  The early hacker comunities nucleated around places where it was relatively easy to get access to a timesharing account.",

Differs from ‘toolkit’ in that the former implies a collection of semi-independent tools with complementary functions, while ‘toolchain’ implies that each of the parts is a serial stage in a rather tightly bound pipeline.

A single post may often result in several posts each responding to a different point in the original.  Some subthreads will actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side comment, possibly degenerating into a flame war, or just as often evolving into a separate discussion.  Hence, discussions aren't really so much threads as they are trees.  Except that they don't really have leaves, or multiple branching roots; usually some lines of discussion will just sort of die off after everyone gets tired of them.

Variants of this can be seen in other BSD versions, though it has been excised from some versions by humorless management droids.

However, no machine or language exactly matching Turing's primitive set has ever been built (other than possibly as a classroom exercise), because it would be horribly slow and far too painful to use.  A Turing tar-pit is any computer language or other tool that shares this property.

    "description": " The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC — the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 — preferred by most PDP-10 hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not ITS or WAITS partisans). TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating system using special paging hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name for the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when customers started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS.  When the name SNARK became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly abandoned when someone objected that krans meant ‘funeral wreath’ in Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply ‘wreath’; this part of the story may be apocryphal). Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of its origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of ‘twenty TENEX’), even though by this point very little of the original TENEX code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&T V6 Unix and BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard “TWENEX”, but the term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation ‘20x’ was also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact, there was a period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of partisans as Unix or ITS — but DEC's decision to scrap all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert to VMS, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.  There is a TOPS-20 home page.",

Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system.  The turning point in Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972—1974, making it the first source-portable OS.  Unix subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and developer-friendly environment.  By 1991, Unix had become the most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world — and since 1996 the variant called Linux has been at the cutting edge of the open source movement.  Many people consider the success of Unix the most important victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see Unix weenie and Unix conspiracy for an opposing point of view).

This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively unreliable and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from AT&T).

This model served as a basis for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for lighting, textures, bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the model is trivial to render and thus is often not suited to demonstrate the complexity of modern research.  Despite this, the tea pot still appears, now and then, in recent papers. More on the teapot's history lives at The History Of The Teapot. Compare lenna, Stanford Bunny",

Indeed, only the widely-distributed Sixth and Seventh Editions are widely known as V[67]; the OS that might today be known as ‘V10’ is instead known in full as “Tenth Edition Research Unix” or just “Tenth Edition” for short.

When these programs are executed, the embedded virus is executed too, thus propagating the ‘infection’.  This normally happens invisibly to the user.  Unlike a worm, a virus cannot infect other computers without assistance.  It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs with their friends (see SEX).  The virus may do nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally. Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks with the display (some viruses include nice display hacks).  Many nasty viruses, written by particularly perversely minded crackers, do irreversible damage, like nuking all the user's files.",

There was never an ‘official’ expansion of WAITS (the name itself having been arrived at by a rather sideways process), but it was frequently glossed as ‘West-coast Alternative to ITS’.  Though WAITS was less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect influence.  The early screen modes of EMACS, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS's ‘E’ editor — one of a family of editors that were the first to do ‘real-time editing’, in which the editing commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting.  The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to have originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX Star, the Macintosh, and the Sun workstations.  Also invented there were bucky bits — thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy.  One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and filter AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system also featured a still-unusual level of support for what is now called multimedia computing, allowing analog audio and video signals to be switched to programming terminals.",

There is a legend about a drive that walked over to the only door to the computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at it!  Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek in the other direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive races.",

Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved.  This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics management only when regular customers started calling and asking for pricing information.  Signetics published a corrected edition of the data book and requested the return of the ‘erroneous’ ones.  Later, in 1972, Signetics bought a double-page spread in Electronics magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April Fools' Day joke.  Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 “fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory” data sheet included diagrams of “bit capacity vs.: Temp.”, “Iff vs. Vff”, “Number of pins remaining vs.: number of socket insertions”, and “AQL vs.: selling price”.

The wumpus lived somewhere in a cave with the topology of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later versions supported other topologies, including an icosahedron and M�bius strip). The player started somewhere at random in the cave with five ‘crooked arrows’; these could be shot through up to three connected rooms, and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for players, the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him) but also by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would pick you up and drop you at a random location (later versions added ‘anaerobic termites’ that ate arrows, bat migrations, and earthquakes that randomly changed pit locations).",

Visual, ‘point-and-shoot’-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves, but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be better served by a command-style interface.  When this happens, the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem.  This term is most often used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG ‘desktop publishing’ programs, for example, are a clear win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them, especially things like newsletters and presentation slides.  When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like TeX or Unix's troff becomes not just desirable but a necessity.
